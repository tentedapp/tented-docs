## Form Submissions Overview

Every tent with forms automatically captures and stores submission data. You can view, manage, and export this data to track leads, analyze conversion rates, and follow up with potential customers.

## Accessing Form Submissions

**From the Tent Details page:**
1. On the **Form Submissions** tile, click **View Form Data**. This button is located below the total number of form submissions for the tent.
2. The **Raw Form Data** window opens and displays a complete record of all form submission data for the tent. It includes the timestamp, form fields, and submitted values.
3. To export the data, click the **Download CSV** button.
4. When you're done, select **Close** to exit the window.
