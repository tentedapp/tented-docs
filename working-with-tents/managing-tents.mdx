## Tent Management Overview

Managing your tents effectively is crucial for maintaining an organized workspace and optimizing your landing page campaigns. Tented provides tools for all aspects of tent lifecycle management. You can find all of your tents in the **Tents** page of your workspace. The list on this page includes their status, last updated date, and creation date. If you have many tents, you can use the search and filter options to quickly find the tent you need.

- Sort by: **Tent Name**, **Last Updated**, and **Created Date** 
- Filter by status: **Any**, **Draft**, **Published**

3. Press **Enter/Return** or click outside the field to save your change.

### Deleting Tents

If you no longer want to keep a tent in your account, you can delete any tent regardless of its status. Keep in mind that if you've shared the live URL of a published tent, that it will no longer be available on the internet when you delete it. If you're ready to delete, follow these steps.

<Warning>
Deleting a tent is permanent and cannot be undone. All associated data, including form submissions and analytics, will be lost forever. Be sure to export any important data before proceeding. Consider using the [clone feature](#cloning-tents) for backups.
</Warning>

**From the Tent Details page:**
1. Click **Tent Actions > Delete** at the top right.
2. Confirm the deletion in the dialog box.

**From the tent list:**
1. Navigate to the **Tents** page.
2. Select the checkbox next to the tent name.
3. Click **Tent Actions > Delete** at the top right.
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog box.

**What Gets Deleted:**
- Tent code and content
- Generation history
- Form submission data
- Analytics data
- Published URL (becomes inactive)

### Cloning Tents

You can clone a tent to create variations of your landing page for A/B testing, or for other reasons. Here are some other use cases for cloning tents:

- Creating variations for different audiences
- Seasonal campaign updates
- Regional or language variations

Note that form submission data, analytics, and the published URL are not cloned. The cloned tent will have a status of **Draft** and will not be live until you [publish](publishing-tents) it.

**From the Tent Details page:**
1. Click **Tent Actions > Clone** at the top right.
2. In the **Clone Tent** window, enter a name for the new tent and click **Clone**.

The tent is cloned and appears in your tent list. It will have a status of **Draft**.

The tent is cloned and appears in your tent list. It will have a status of **Draft**.

## Publishing Management

### Unpublishing a Tent

A tent can be unpublished at any time so that it's no longer available on the web.

**From the Tent Details page:**
1. Select **Tent Actions > Unpublish** at the top right.
2. Confirm that you want to unpublish the tent.

The tent becomes private. The URL is inactive and the tent status returns to **Draft**.

You can [republish](publishing-tents) the tent later if needed.
