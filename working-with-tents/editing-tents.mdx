## Advanced Editing Techniques

### Iterative Refinement

**Start Broad, Get Specific:**
1. **Layout**: "Make the layout more modern"
2. **Sections**: "Add more spacing between sections"
3. **Details**: "Increase padding to 2rem on all sections"

**Build Incrementally:**
- Make one change at a time
- Test each change before proceeding
- Build complexity gradually

### Visual References

**Upload Images for Inspiration:**
- Screenshots of designs you like
- Brand guidelines or style guides
- Reference websites or competitors

**Describe Visual Elements:**
- "Make it look like the Apple website"
- "Use a design similar to Stripe's landing page"
- "Add shadows like in Material Design"

### Context-Aware Editing

**Reference Existing Elements:**
- "Make the pricing buttons match the hero button style"
- "Use the same font as the headline for subheadings"
- "Apply the same color scheme throughout"

**Maintain Consistency:**
- Reference previously established styles
- Build on existing design patterns
- Maintain visual hierarchy

## Chat Interface Best Practices

### Effective Communication

**Be Clear and Specific:**
- Instead of: "Fix the layout"
- Try: "Make the hero section take up the full viewport height and center the content both horizontally and vertically"

**Use Action Words:**
- "Add", "Change", "Remove", "Update", "Make"
- "Increase", "Decrease", "Move", "Center"
- "Replace", "Insert", "Delete"

**Provide Context:**
- Mention which section you're referring to
- Reference existing elements by name
- Describe the desired outcome

### Handling Complex Requests

**Break Down Large Changes:**
- Instead of: "Redesign the entire page"
- Try: "First, update the hero section, then we'll work on the features"

**Use Sequential Instructions:**
- "First, change the background color"
- "Then, update the text color to match"
- "Finally, adjust the button styling"

**Verify Understanding:**
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Confirm changes before proceeding
- Request explanations of modifications
