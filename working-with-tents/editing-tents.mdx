## Editing Workflow

Editing tents is designed to be intuitive and conversational. You can make changes through natural language, see updates in real-time, and iterate quickly to perfect your landing page.

To edit an existing tent, open it in the tent editor: 

1. From the **Tents** page in your workspace, click on the tent you want to edit to open the **Tent Details** page.
2. Select **Edit** at the top right to open the tent editor.
3. In the chat input area, describe the changes you want to make. Be as specific as possible.
4. Click the send icon to submit your request. Changes typically take 4-5 seconds to process.

The following sections outline different types of edits you can make, advanced techniques for refining your tent, and best practices for using the chat interface effectively.

## Advanced Editing Techniques

### Iterative Refinement

**Build Incrementally:**
- Make one change at a time
- Test each change before proceeding
- Build complexity gradually

### Visual References

**Upload Images for Inspiration:**
- Screenshots of designs you like
- Brand guidelines or style guides
- Reference websites or competitors

**Describe Visual Elements:**
- "Make it look like the Apple website"
- "Use a design similar to Stripe's landing page"
- "Add shadows like in Material Design"

### Context-Aware Editing

**Reference Existing Elements:**
- "Make the pricing buttons match the hero button style"
- "Use the same font as the headline for subheadings"
- "Apply the same color scheme throughout"

**Maintain Consistency:**
- Reference previously established styles
- Build on existing design patterns
- Maintain visual hierarchy

## Chat Interface Best Practices

### Handling Complex Requests

**Break Down Large Changes:**
- Instead of: "Redesign the entire page"
- Try: "First, update the hero section, then we'll work on the features"

**Use Sequential Instructions:**
- "First, change the background color"
- "Then, update the text color to match"
- "Finally, adjust the button styling"

**Verify Understanding:**
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Confirm changes before proceeding
- Request explanations of modifications

## Troubleshooting Edits

### When Changes Don't Apply

**Check Your Request:**
- Ensure clear, specific instructions
- Provide sufficient context

**Review Chat History:**
- Look for error messages
- Check if previous changes conflicted
- Verify the AI understood your request

**Try Alternative Approaches:**
- Rephrase your request
- Break down complex changes
- Use more specific terminology

**Ask the AI to verify its work. Telling it to THINK HARD adds reasoning to its workflow:**
- "Please review the last change and ensure it was applied correctly"
- "Please double-check the layout adjustments I requested"
- "Please THINK HARD and remove the predictive-scheduling dashboard image from the hero section; I still see it even after you recent attempt to remove it"
