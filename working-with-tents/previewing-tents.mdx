## Preview Overview

Previewing your tent is a crucial step before publishing. Tented's preview system allows you to test your landing page across different devices, verify functionality, and ensure everything works perfectly before going live.

## How to Preview Your Tent on the Web

There are two ways to preview how a tent will look on the web:

- Open the tent in the tent editor and click **Preview in New Tab** at the top of the screen.

## How to Preview Your Tent on Mobile Devices

To preview how a tent will look on a mobile device:

 1. In the tent editor, click the **mobile preview icon**.
 2. The mobile preview defaults to the **iPhone 17 Pro Max**. To switch to a different device, select the drop-down arrow next to the device name. 
  <tip>You can also specify exact screen dimensions by entering them in the width and height boxes in the top-center of the screen.</tip>
 3. When you're done previewing on mobile, click the **mobile preview icon** again to return to the standard tent editor view.
