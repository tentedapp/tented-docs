## Preview Overview

Previewing your tent is a crucial step before publishing. Tented's preview system allows you to test your landing page across different devices, verify functionality, and ensure everything works perfectly before going live.

## How to Preview Your Tent on the Web

There are two ways to preview how a tent will look on the web:

- Open the tent in the tent editor and click **Preview in New Tab** at the top of the screen.

- Open the tent details page, hover over the preview tile, and click the **Open Preview** button that appears.

## How to Preview Your Tent on Mobile Devices

To preview how a tent will look on a mobile device:

 1. In the tent editor, click the **mobile preview icon**.
 2. The mobile preview defaults to the **iPhone 17 Pro Max**. To switch to a different device, select the drop-down arrow next to the device name. 
  <tip>You can also specify exact screen dimensions by entering them in the width and height boxes in the top-center of the screen.</tip>
 3. When you're done previewing on mobile, click the **mobile preview icon** again to return to the standard tent editor view.

## Interactive Testing

Before publishing your tent, it's crucial to test all interactive elements to ensure they function correctly.

Submit test data to all forms and verify form validation works correctly for fields like email and phone numbers. Make sure to click through all links and buttons on the page. You should also test smooth scrolling to sections and verify anchor links work properly. Check external link behavior to confirm they open in a new tab if necessary.

Finally, for interactive elements, rigorously test hover effects and animations for visual appeal. Crucially, verify mobile menu functionality on smaller screens, check dropdown menus and modals to ensure they open and close as intended, and thoroughly test all javascript interactions that control dynamic behavior.
