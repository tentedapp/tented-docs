## Publishing Overview

Publishing your tent makes it available on the web with a unique URL that you can share with your audience. The publishing process is simple and fast, taking just a few clicks to go from draft to live website.

## Publishing Process

### Initial Publishing

Make sure you [preview your tent](previewing-tents) first.

There are two ways to publish your tent to the web.

**From the tent editor:**
1. Click **Publish** at the top right of the screen.
2. Confirm publishing in the dialog box.
