## The Art of AI Prompting

Writing effective prompts is crucial for getting the best results from Tented's AI. A well-crafted prompt can mean the difference between a generic landing page and a perfectly tailored, conversion-optimized page.

## Prompt Structure

### The Perfect Prompt Formula

**Context + Goal + Details + Constraints = Great Results**

- **Context:** Who you are and what you do
- **Goal:** What you want to achieve
- **Details:** Specific features and content
- **Constraints:** Technical or design limitations

### Example Breakdown

**Poor Prompt:**
"Create a landing page"

**Good Prompt:**
"Create a landing page for a B2B SaaS project management tool targeting remote teams of 10-50 people. Include a hero section with clear value proposition, key features highlighting collaboration and productivity, pricing tiers for small teams and enterprises, customer testimonials, and a contact form. Use a professional blue and white color scheme with modern, clean design."
