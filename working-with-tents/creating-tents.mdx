## Creating Your First Tent

Creating a tent in Tented is as simple as describing what you want in natural language. Our AI will generate a complete, modern landing page based on your description.

## The Creation Process

### 1. Start with a Prompt

Navigate to your dashboard and click **"Create New Tent"**. In the prompt interface, describe your landing page:

**Good prompts include:**
- Your industry or business type
- Target audience
- Key features or benefits to highlight
- Desired page sections (hero, features, pricing, contact, etc.)
- Brand personality (professional, playful, modern, etc.)

**Example prompts:**
- "Create a landing page for a SaaS productivity tool targeting busy professionals, with a hero section, key features, pricing tiers, and a contact form"
- "Build a landing page for a local coffee shop with menu highlights, location info, hours, and online ordering"
- "Design a portfolio page for a freelance graphic designer showcasing recent projects and client testimonials"

### 2. Add Brand Settings

Before generating, customize your brand identity:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Brand Colors">
    Set your primary and secondary colors to match your brand:
    - **Primary Color**: Your main brand color (used for buttons, links, highlights)
    - **Secondary Color**: Supporting color for accents and secondary elements
    - **Background Color**: Page background color
    - **Text Color**: Main text color for readability
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="font" title="Typography">
    Choose fonts that reflect your brand personality:
    - **Heading Font**: For titles and major headings
    - **Body Font**: For paragraph text and content
    - **Font Weight**: Bold, regular, or light variations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="image" title="Brand Assets">
    Upload visual elements to enhance your tent:
    - **Logo**: Your company or product logo
    - **Product Images**: Photos of your product or service
    - **Background Images**: Hero section or background imagery
    - **Icons**: Custom icons that match your brand
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Understanding Generations

A **generation** is a complete version of your tent created by AI. Each time you create a new tent or make significant changes, a new generation is created.

**Generation Types:**
- **Initial Generation**: The first version created from your prompt
- **Iteration**: Updates made through chat-based editing
- **Reverted Generation**: When you go back to a previous version

**Generation Features:**
- Each generation has a unique ID and timestamp
- You can revert to any previous generation
- Generations preserve your brand settings and uploaded assets
- Version history tracks all changes and iterations

### 4. Generate Your Tent

Once you've set your prompt and brand settings:

1. **Click "Generate Tent"** to start the AI creation process
2. **Wait for generation** (typically 30-60 seconds)
3. **Review the preview** in the tent editor
4. **Make adjustments** using the chat interface if needed

## Best Practices for Tent Creation

### Writing Effective Prompts

**Be Specific:**
- Instead of: "Create a landing page"
- Try: "Create a landing page for a B2B SaaS project management tool targeting remote teams, with hero section, key features, pricing, testimonials, and contact form"

**Include Context:**
- Your industry and target market
- Key value propositions
- Desired page sections
- Call-to-action goals

**Set Expectations:**
- Mention if you want specific design styles
- Include any must-have elements
- Specify mobile-first or desktop-first approach

### Brand Settings Tips

**Color Selection:**
- Use your existing brand colors for consistency
- Ensure good contrast for accessibility
- Consider how colors work together

**Typography:**
- Choose fonts that match your brand personality
- Ensure readability across devices
- Consider loading performance

**Images:**
- Use high-quality, relevant images
- Optimize file sizes for web performance
- Include alt text for accessibility
