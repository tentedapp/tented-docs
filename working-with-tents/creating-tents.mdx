## Creating Your First Tent

Creating a tent in Tented is as simple as describing what you want in natural language. Our AI will generate a complete, modern landing page based on your description.

## The Creation Process

### 1. Set Your Branding

Before you create your tent, customize your brand identity. You're prompted to do this when you first sign up. Here's the information you'll need to provide:

 - **Primary Brand Color**: Your main brand color (used for buttons)
 - **Brand Logo**: The logo that represents your brand
 - **Brand Icon**: A smaller icon version of your logo

Logos should have a 3:1 aspect ratio and a transparent background. They should be saved as a PNG or SVG file for best results. Icons should have a 1:1 (square) aspect ratio. They should also be saved as a transparent PNG or SVG file.

After you sign up for Tented, you'll see a prompt like this:

1. Set your primary brand color by entering a hex code or using the color picker.
2. Upload your logo and icon.
3. Click **Save** to finish.

Or, you can skip this step and add your branding later in your [Workspace Settings](../configuring-tented/workspace-settings).

### 2. Write a Prompt

Navigate to the **Home** page in your dashboard. In the prompt interface, describe your landing page.

**Good prompts include:**
- Your industry or business type
- Target audience
- Key features or benefits to highlight
- Desired page sections (hero, features, pricing, contact, etc.)
- Brand personality (professional, playful, modern, etc.)

**Example prompts:**
- "Create a landing page for a SaaS productivity tool targeting busy professionals, with a hero section, key features, pricing tiers, and a contact form"
- "Build a professional landing page for a 'Predictive Scheduling' feature with a sign-up form to capture early access leads"

For more information, see our [Best Practices for AI Prompting](best-practices-prompting) guide.

### 3. Generate Your Tent

Once you've set your branding and written your prompt:

1. **Click the send icon** to start the AI creation process.
2. **Wait for generation** (typically 60-70 seconds).
3. **Preview** your new tent. For details, see [Previewing Tents](previewing-tents).

### 4. Refine and Iterate

Refine your tent through natural conversation in the chat interface. Request changes like:

- "Add a testimonials section"
- "Make the call-to-action button larger"  
- "Add a sign-up form at the bottom"

### 5. Add Images and files
Consider enhancing your tent with images and downloadable content like brochures, reports, or white papers. There are two ways to add an image or file.

**From the chat input area:**

1. In the chat input area, click the **plus button > Add Images or Files**.
2. Select the image or file from your computer.
3. A thumbnail for the file appears above the chat input area. Reference it in your prompt. For example, "Add this AI scheduling graphic centered at the bottom of the hero section, below the stats."
4. Click the **send icon** to submit your prompt with the image or file reference.

**Through the Manage Assets option:**

1. In the tent editor, click the **image icon** in the top menu.
2. In the **Tent Assets** window that appears, click **Add File**.
3. Select the image or file from your computer.
4. The file is added to the **Tent Assets** list. You can now reference it in your prompts. For example, "Add this brochure download link below the pricing section."

    Your tent is now accessible worldwide!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter while working with Tented's AI, along with suggested solutions.

**Preview Not Updating:**
If you notice the preview isn't updating as expected, a few steps can resolve this: first, try refreshing the preview panel. If that doesn't work, check for JavaScript errors in the console, and finally, carefully verify your code syntax for any mistakes that might be preventing the update. 

**Changes Not Applied:**
If you find that changes you requested are not being applied correctly, you should ensure your instructions are clear and specific to the AI. It's also helpful to check the chat history for any errors or confusing previous inputs, or simply try rephrasing your request to see if a different approach yields the correct result. 

**Layout Issues:**
For any layout problems, you should begin by testing the output on different screen sizes to identify the scope of the issue. You should then check your CSS for conflicts that might be causing unexpected rendering. Use browser developer tools for detailed inspection and debugging of the layout elements.

## What Happens Next?

After creating your tent, you might want to [edit and iterate](editing-tents) to perfect it. You can also track form submissions and analytics on the [Tent Details](viewing-tent-details) page.
