## Custom Domains Overview

While Tented doesn't yet support direct custom domain hosting, you can use DNS redirects to point your own domain to your tents. This allows you to maintain your brand identity while leveraging Tented's powerful hosting infrastructure.

## How DNS Redirects Work

### Basic Concept

**Domain Redirect Process:**
1. **Your Domain**: `landing.yourcompany.com`
2. **DNS Record**: Points to Tented's servers
3. **Tented Hosting**: Your tent is hosted on Tented
4. **Branded URL**: Visitors see your domain

**Benefits of DNS Redirects:**
- Maintain brand identity with your domain
- Professional appearance for your landing pages
- SEO benefits from branded URLs
- Easy to remember and share

### Technical Implementation

**DNS Configuration:**
- **CNAME Record**: `landing` → `tented.ai`
- **A Record**: Point to Tented's IP address
- **SSL Certificate**: Automatically provisioned by Tented
- **Global CDN**: Fast loading worldwide

**Redirect Types:**
- **301 Redirect**: Permanent redirect (SEO-friendly)
- **302 Redirect**: Temporary redirect
- **Frame Redirect**: Display your domain with Tented content
- **JavaScript Redirect**: Client-side redirect
