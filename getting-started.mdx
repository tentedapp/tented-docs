## Welcome to Tented 🏕️

Tented is an AI go-to-market platform for instant, personalized landing pages. Generate beautiful, modern web pages with simple prompts. Refine and iterate using chat.

## What is a Tent?

A **Tent** is your personalized landing page - a complete, standalone HTML page you can customize for different audiences, campaigns, or use cases. Each tent includes:

- **Modern, responsive design** with full-width layouts
- **Interactive elements** and animations
- **Form handling** with built-in submission processing
- **SEO optimization** and proper meta tags
- **Brand customization** options

## Get Started in Four Steps

Here's a high-level overview of the process to create, edit, and publish your first tent.

### Step 1: Add Your Branding

    Upload your branding assets to match your company's visual identity:
    
    1. **Upload your logo** to appear in the header.
    2. **Set your brand colors** for buttons and accents.
    3. **Upload a company icon** for browser tabs.

### Step 2: Create Your First Tent

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Write your prompt">
    Creating a tent is as simple as describing what you want in natural language. Here are some examples of effective prompts:
    
       - "Create a landing page for a SaaS productivity tool with a hero section, features, and pricing"
       - "Design a portfolio page for a freelance designer with projects and testimonials"
    
      ![A screenshot of a detailed prompt for an early-access signup page for a new feature called "Predictive Scheduling". The prompt is "Generate a landing page for our new feature, 'Predictive Scheduling'. The page must be high-converting and focused solely on capturing early access signups. Include a hero section, features, and pricing. Use a professional tone."](../images/initial-prompt.png)

    For more information on writing effective prompts, see our [Best Practices for AI Prompting](../working-with-tents/best-practices-prompting) guide.

  <Accordion icon="image" title="Add images and personalization">
    Enhance your tent with visuals and more:
    
    - **Upload images** to include product photos or graphics.
    - **Add downloadable files** like brochures or white papers.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Edit and Iterate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="comments" title="Chat with your tent">
    Once your tent is generated, you can refine it through natural conversation. Here are some examples of refinements you can ask for:
    
    - "Change the color scheme to blue and white"
    - "Add a testimonials section"
    - "Make the call-to-action button larger"
    - "Add a contact form at the bottom"
    
    The AI will make these changes in real-time while you watch the preview update.
