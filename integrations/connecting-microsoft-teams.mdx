Tented integrates with Microsoft Teams to send real-time notifications when forms are submitted on your published tents. This guide walks you through connecting your Teams workspace to Tented.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Admin or Owner access** to your Tented workspace
- **Permission to install apps** in your Microsoft Teams workspace (or access to request app installation from your Teams admin)

## Step 1: Find Tented in the Teams App Store

1. Open **Microsoft Teams** (desktop or web app)
2. Click on **Apps** in the left sidebar
3. Search for **"Tented"** in the app search bar
4. Click on the **Tented** app to view its details


## Step 2: Add Tented to Your Team

1. Click the **Add** button on the Tented app page
2. Select **Add to a team** from the dropdown options
3. Choose the **team** where you want to receive notifications
4. Select a **channel** where the Tented bot will be added (this is typically your General channel or a dedicated notifications channel)
5. Click **Set up a bot** to complete the installation

<Note>
  When you add Tented to a team via a standard channel, the app gains access to **all standard channels** in that team. You'll be able to send notifications to any standard channel without additional setup.
</Note>

## Step 3: Complete the Connection via Deep Link

After adding the app to your team, Tented will send a **welcome message** to the channel you selected during installation.

1. Look for the welcome message from **Tented** in your channel
2. Click the **Connect to Tented** button in the welcome message
3. You'll be redirected to Tented where you can select which **Tented workspace** to link with your Teams tenant
4. Confirm the connection

<Check>
  Once connected, your Tented workspace is linked to your Microsoft Teams tenant. You can now set up automations to send notifications to any standard channel in the connected team.
</Check>

## Step 4: Set Up a Teams Automation in Tented

Now that your Teams workspace is connected, you can create automations to send notifications when forms are submitted.

1. In Tented, navigate to the **tent** you want to add an automation to
2. Click on **Automations** in the tent details panel
3. Click **Add Automation**
4. Select **Send Teams Message** as the action type
5. Choose the **form** that should trigger the notification
6. Select the **channel** where notifications should be sent from the dropdown list
7. Click **Save** to activate the automation

<Info>
  The channel dropdown will show all standard channels available in your connected team. Simply select the channel where you want form submission notifications to appear.
</Info>

## How It Works

When a visitor submits a form on your published tent:

1. Tented receives the form submission
2. The automation triggers and sends a formatted message to your selected Teams channel
3. The message includes:
   - Form name and tent details
   - Submission timestamp
   - A link to the tent
   - All submitted form data

## Automatic Cleanup & Disconnection

Tented automatically manages your Teams connection to ensure everything stays in sync:

<Warning>
  **If the Tented app is removed from your team**, Tented will automatically:
  - Disable all Teams automations for that workspace
  - Clean up the connection between Tented and your Teams tenant
  
  You'll need to re-add the app and complete the connection process again to restore Teams notifications.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **If the app loses access to a specific channel** (for example, if the channel is deleted or converted to a private channel), Tented will automatically disable automations targeting that channel. You'll need to update your automation to use a different channel.
</Warning>

## Private Channels

<Note>
  **Private channels require separate installation.** When you add Tented to a team, it only has access to standard channels. To send notifications to a private channel, you must add the Tented app directly to that private channel:
  
  1. Open the private channel in Teams
  2. Click the **+** button or go to channel settings
  3. Select **Manage apps** or **Get more apps**
  4. Search for and add **Tented** to the private channel
  
  Once installed, the private channel will appear in your channel selection dropdown in Tented.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see any channels in the dropdown

- Ensure you've completed the connection process by clicking the deep link in the welcome message
- Verify the Tented app is still installed in your team
- Check that your Tented workspace has an active Teams connection in workspace settings

### Notifications aren't being sent

- Confirm the automation is **enabled** (toggle should be on)
- Verify the tent is **published**
- Check that the selected channel still exists and the app has access to it

### The welcome message didn't appear

- Check the channel where you added the app—the message is sent there
- Look in the channel's chat history; it may have been sent earlier
- Try removing and re-adding the Tented app to the team

## Disconnecting Teams

To disconnect Microsoft Teams from your Tented workspace:

1. Remove the **Tented** app from your team in Microsoft Teams
2. Tented will automatically detect the removal and clean up the connection

Alternatively, you can manage your integrations in your **Workspace Settings**.
